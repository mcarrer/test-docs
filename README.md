## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

This is a new paragraph. ![IoT Architecture](.gitbook/assets/everywareiot.jpg)

This is new TEST!!!!

```text
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
